# Gravitational Wave Analysis

## Introduction
Gravitational waves are cosmic ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by massive objects like black holes or neutron stars. In 2015, scientists achieved a significant milestone by detecting these waves directly using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). This project explores the fascinating domain of gravitational wave physics, using data from LIGO to analyze a particular binary system (GW150914).

## Objective
The objective of this project is to delve into the theoretical aspects of gravitational waves and to use publicly available data from LIGO to see these waves in action. The project is divided into two parts:
1. Theoretical analysis of gravitational waves.
2. Practical application using LIGO data to study the binary system GW150914.

## Data
The data used in this project is publicly available from the LIGO detectors. It includes waveform data for the binary system GW150914.

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Theoretical Analysis:**
   - Understanding the nature of gravitational waves.
   - Estimating the intensity of radiated gravitational waves using dimensional analysis.
   - Estimating the distance of the source (GW150914) based on waveform data.

2. **Practical Analysis:**
   - Using specific libraries to analyze the LIGO data.
   - Drawing waveforms and estimating the distance to the source.
   - Comparing the results with existing measurements.

## Results
The analysis includes generating waveforms of gravitational waves and estimating the distance of the source. The results are compared with existing measurements to validate the accuracy.
